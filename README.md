# _Application name: SIDEK!CK_

#### _this application is a meet-up platform , 11/26/2016_

#### By _**Jackson Meyer**_

## Description

_The premise of this app is that the dating app sector is very competitive, and quite visceral and ugly, the meetup app and platforms are clunky and not super easy to use. This app will settle into a niche and bridge the gap, a relationship should be built on mutual interests and activities; thus, Sidek!ck was born. A spontaneous meetup platform: anything, anywhere, NOW_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _all one has to do at this point, is download my app from github, open as an android studios project, and run it on an emulator or plugged in android device_


_I hope to in the next 2 months have sidekick up on the google play store and you can just download it and open the app_

## Known Bugs

_There are not sny bugs at this point_

## Support and contact details

_please contact me at jackson.meyer7@gmail.com if you find anything wrong with my app_

## Technologies Used

_This project has been built entirely in android studios, written in XML and java_
